# Machine Learning Projects

This repository includes machine learning projects that I developed independently to practice data science techniques.

## Projects

- **Diabetes Prediction:**  
  Built a classification model to predict diabetes outcomes using clinical data.
  
- **Simple Regression:**  
  Applied linear regression to a synthetic dataset to understand model fitting.

- **Clustering Analysis:**  
  Performed k-means clustering to analyze patterns in customer segmentation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing (Pandas, Numpy)
- Machine learning model building (Scikit-learn)
- Evaluation metrics and model validation
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
